## Project Reflection

This project was built during my Masters. It was my addicional learning and projects in web application sector.

The main goal was to simple game 8-ball web application with vanilla JavaScript functions and utilities. The project was intended to resemble a real 8-ball toy.

The project helped me consolidate my existing knowledge and gain experience in writing code in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
